# Key-Logger
This is a chrome extension that utilizes chrome's storage api to log what a user is typing while surfing in their chrome browser. The website is used as a key and an array containing logs are stored as the value.

The data is not being sent back to any server it is only being stored in the google's cloud storage. So feel free to play around with it without any worries.
